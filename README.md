# Doublespeak

A sleek, translation chat app for connecting people without a language barrier.

## Inspiration:

Being fun and creative in coding is something both Chase and Krista find important. They created an API with 2 original translation languages, cleverly named after one another, and implemented 3 others including using emojis, morse code and upside-down! They say their main inspirations were: wanting to learn react-native, wanting to be creative & fun and incorporate APIs.

## What it does:

Doublespeak is a chat app where you can create and join chats with your friends and send messages in funny and cryptic languages.

## How Was it Built:

It was built using a backend Firebase database to store chat room and message history and users credentials. Firebase allowed for a quick and easy set. The front-end was built using React Native. The reason we chose React Native is it allows for easy development on iOS and Android so doublespeak can be used by more people.
